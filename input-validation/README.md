# User Input Validation

This JavaScript script prompts the user to enter a number greater than 100 and ensures the input is correct using a `while` loop.

## Instructions

1. The script continuously prompts the user to enter a number greater than 100 until a valid input is provided.
2. If the user enters a number greater than 100 or leaves the input blank, the loop exits using the `break` statement.
3. If the user enters a number less than or equal to 100, an alert is displayed, notifying the user that the entered number is not greater than 100.
4. Once a valid input is provided, the loop exits, and a final alert is displayed, indicating that the user has entered a number greater than 100.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file containing the script in a web browser.
2. The script will continuously prompt the user until a valid input is provided.
3. An alert will confirm that the user has entered a number greater than 100.
