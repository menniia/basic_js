# Regular Expressions

Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp," are powerful patterns that allow programmers to match, search, and manipulate text in a flexible and precise way. They are a fundamental tool for text processing in many programming languages.

## About This Folder

This folder contains examples and resources related to regular expressions. You can learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookahead, and other techniques to match and manipulate text effectively.

## What Are Regular Expressions?

Regular expressions are made up of special characters and symbols that define search patterns. These patterns can be used to:

- **Match:** Verify if a given string follows a specific pattern.
- **Search:** Find specific pieces of text within a larger document or string.
- **Replace:** Replace matched text with other text or modify it in some way.

Regex can be incredibly useful in a variety of scenarios, including text validation, data extraction, and text manipulation.
