## Introduction

Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text processing in JavaScript. This repository contains a set of JavaScript code snippets that illustrate different aspects of working with regular expressions.

## Code Snippets

- **Match Literal Strings**: Demonstrates how to match literal strings.
- **Match a Literal String with Different Possibilities**: Shows how to match different possibilities.
- **Ignore Case While Matching**: Illustrates how to perform case-insensitive matching.
- **Extract Matches**: Shows how to extract matches from a string.
- **Find More Than the First Match**: Uses the global search flag to find multiple matches.
- **Match Anything with Wildcard Period**: Matches any character with the wildcard period.
- **Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities**: Matches single characters from a set of possibilities.
- **Match Letters of the Alphabet**: Matches letters from the English alphabet.
- **Match Numbers and Letters of the Alphabet**: Matches numbers and letters from a specific range.
